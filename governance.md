## Values

The HAMi and its leadership embrace the following values:

* Openness: Communication and decision-making happens in the open and is discoverable for future
  reference. As much as possible, all discussions and work take place in public
  forums and open repositories.

* Fairness: All stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback and submit
  contributions, which will be considered on their merits.

* Community over Product or Company: Sustaining and growing our community takes
  priority over shipping code or sponsors' organizational goals. Each
  contributor participates in the project as an individual.

* Inclusivity: We innovate through different perspectives and skill sets, which
  can only be accomplished in a welcoming and respectful environment.

* Participation: Responsibilities within the project are earned through
  participation, and there is a clear path up the contributor ladder into leadership
  positions.

## Membership

The [Community Membership](./CONTRIBUTOR-LADDER.md)

Currently, the maintainers are the governing body for the project. This may
change as the community grows, such as by adopting an elected steering committee.

## Meetings

Time zones permitting, Maintainers are expected to participate in the public
developer meeting, which occurs
[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YC6hco03_oXbF9IOUPJ29VWEddmITIKIfSmBX8JtGBw/edit).  

Maintainers will also have closed meetings in order to discuss security reports
or Code of Conduct violations. Such meetings should be scheduled by any
Maintainer on receipt of a security issue or CoC report. All current Maintainers
must be invited to such closed meetings, except for any Maintainer who is
accused of a CoC violation.

## Code of Conduct

[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
violations by community members will be referred to the CNCF Code of Conduct
Committee. Should the CNCF CoC Committee need to work with the project on resolution, the
Maintainers will appoint a non-involved contributor to work with them.

## Modifying this Charter

Changes to this Governance and its supporting documents may be approved by 
a 2/3 vote of the Maintainers.
